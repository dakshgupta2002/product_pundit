          Hi, we are the Product-Pundits. We provide consolidated reviews from
          multiple platforms for a product and make it easy for you to make a
          decision for yourself. Don't trust us, trust yourself!

          Product Pundit is an independent, transparent and trusted resource.
          Our mission is to help consumers and businesses make smarter, better,
          faster and more informed decisions. Users can easily
          research, filter, and compare products and services. We compile
          prices, comments, and product specifications from marketing databases
          and sources, and present them to users in a visual table with filters
          and ratings. We link users with millions of certified
          products, retailers and brands with one click. 
          <br/> <br/>
          We are bringing transparency, credit and fairness to the online and offline markets.
          We help users think like experts in just about any topic, from
          hospitals to motors to dog breeds and hundreds more. We will always be
          honest with our users and tell them the truth. If we think a product
          or a brand is great, we'll tell users so. If it's not, we'll tell
          users that, too. With us, users will find the right product,
          at the right price, anywhere and every time.
